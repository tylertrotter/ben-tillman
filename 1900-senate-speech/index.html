		<p class="article-intro"><i>Senator John C. Spooner of Wisconsin was engaged in debate with Tillman just prior to this speech. Spooner had alluded to the South Carolina Terror Campaign of 1876 in a negative light which prompted Tillman to give the following defense of it.

			<h1>Senate Speech</h1>
			<small>by Benjamin Tillman March 23, 1900</small>
		</header>

		<hr>

		<p>…[Spooner] said we had taken their rights away from them. He asked me was it right to murder them in order to carry the elections. I never saw one murdered. I never saw one shot at an election. It was the riots before the election, precipitated by their own hot-headedness in attempting to hold the government<a href="#note-1" id="text-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, that brought on conflicts between the races and caused the shotgun to be used. That is what I meant by saying we used the shotgun.</p>

		<p>I want to call the Senator's attention to one fact. He said that the Republican party gave the negroes the ballot in order to protect themselves against the indignities and wrongs that were attempted to be heaped upon them by the enactment of the black code. I say it was because the Republicans of that day, led by Thad Stevens, wanted to put white necks under black heels and to get revenge. There is a difference of opinion. You have your opinion about it, and I have mine, and we can never agree.</p>
		
		<p>I want to ask the Senator this proposition in arithmetic: In my State there were 135,000 negro voters, or negroes of voting age, and some 90,000 or 95,000 white voters. General Canby<a href="#note-2" id="text-2"><sup>2</sup></a> set up a carpetbag government there and turned our State over to this majority. Now, I want to ask you, with a free vote and a fair count, how are you going to beat 135,000 by 95,000? How are you going to do it? You had set us an impossible task. You had handcuffed us and thrown away the key, and you propped your carpetbag negro government with bayonets. Whenever it was necessary to sustain the government you held it up by the Army.</p> 
		
		<p>Mr. President<a href="#note-3" id="text-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, I have not the facts and figures here, but I want the country to get the full view of the Southern side of this question and the justification for anything we did. We were sorry we had the necessity forced upon us, but we could not help it, and as white men we are not sorry for it, and we do not propose to apologize for anything we have done in connection with it. We took the government away from them in 1876. We did take it. If no other Senator has come here previous to this time who would acknowledge it, more is the pity. We have had no fraud in our elections in South Carolina since 1884. There has been no organized Republican party in the State.</p> 
		
		<p>We did not disfranchise the negroes until 1895.<a href="#note-4" id="text-4"><sup>29</sup></a> Then we had a <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/sc-constitutional-convention" target="_blank">constitutional convention</a> convened which took the matter up calmly, deliberately, and avowedly with the purpose of disfranchising as many of them as we could under the <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xiv" target="_blank">fourteenth</a> and <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xv" target="_blank">fifteenth</a> amendments. We adopted the educational qualification as the only means left to us, and the negro is as contented and as prosperous and as well protected in South Carolina to-day as in any State of the Union south of the Potomac. He is not meddling with politics, for he found that the more he meddled with them the worse off he got. As to his “rights"—I will not discuss them now. We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be equal to the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him. I would to God the last one of them was in Africa and that none of them had ever been brought to our shores. But I will not pursue the subject further.</p>
